# HalenHardy's WordPress Theme!

With comments!

## What's here?

`assets/` contains static front-end files and images. In other words, your Sass files, JS files, SVGs, or any PNGs would live here.

`lib/` contains files for custom post type arguments and taxonomies. These are added to WordPress inside functions.php and could be included there, but are separated into other files to keep functions.php a bit cleaner.

`views/` contains all of your Twig templates. These correspond 1 to 1 with the PHP files that make the data available to the Twig templates.
